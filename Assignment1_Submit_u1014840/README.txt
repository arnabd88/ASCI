Prob1.m    - Matlab code for Prob1
Prob1.png  - .png plot corresponding to Prob1(refer here if plot in pdf is difficult to view)


Prob2.m    - Matlab code for Prob2
g_c_x.m    - The function for Prob2
g_c_x_d.m  - The function derivative in Prob2
Prob2.png  - .png plot corresponding to Prob2(refer here if plot in pdf is difficult to view)
Prob2-slope.png - .png plot of the first derivative of the function(refer here if plot in pdf is difficult to view))


Prob3.m      - Matlab code for Prob3
Prob3.png    - .png plot corresponding to Prob3(refer here if plot in pdf is difficult to view)


Prob4.m      - Matlab code for Prob4
Prob4.png    - .png plot corresponding to Prob4(refer here if plot in pdf is difficult to view)


Prob5.m      - Matlab code for Prob5
